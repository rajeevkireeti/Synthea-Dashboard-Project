# Synthea Dashboard Project

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates data analysis and visualization skills using the Synthea dataset (synthetic health data). 
The visualizations include:
1. Age Group Distribution
2. PHQ-9 Scores Analysis
3. Depression Treatment Analysis
4. CPT Code Utilization
